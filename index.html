        <p>Front End Developer looking to help create/improve code to make it easier for users to interact with and be a little bit nicer on the eyes. With a Bachelor of Arts Degree with a major in Studio Arts and minor in Business, from the Leeds School of Business, at the University of Colorado Boulder.</p>

        <p>This gives me a background that helps me understand how users enjoy being visually stimulated, as well as data analytics that show what people are more interested and how this determines where/how they want to interface with items or subjects they want to explore in more depth.</p>

        <p>In combination with my certificate of completion from The University of Denver in coding which expanded my abilityâ€™s in JavaScript, jQuery, CSS, and HTML (ex). I love learning new technological processes and enjoy collaborating with back end developers to plan, organize, and build elegant code that is fluent for users to operate.</p>
